Subject: [PATCH 01/11] present: don't do a vblank abort on a pending flip
 during window destruction

As part of present's window destroy function, any vblanks associated with the
destroyed window are aborted and destroyed. However, this can include a
pending flip. This means that when the corresponding flip event is finally
processed it gets ignored. As a result, any deferred unflip is never performed
and, more importantly, the now idle pixmap is never destroyed. This results in
a leak between server resets.

Fix this by preventing any pending flip, associated with the window being
destroyed, from being aborted and destroyed during window destruction.
